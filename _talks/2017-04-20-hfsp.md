[Download the slides](nwrug-april-2017-hosting-for-side-projects.pdf) from the talk I gave at [NWRUG in April 2017](http://nwrug.org/events/april-2017-double-bill-hosting-for-side-projects-and-testing-with-cake).

Below are some more detailed notes to accompany the talk too. If you give any of this a try and need more details at all please [drop me a line](/contact/).

## Conventions
The instructions assume a user will be added to the server that will be used for running the hosted applications. In these notes that user is called `deploy`.
The application installation instructions use an app name of `demoapp` which can be replaced as appropriate.
Commands that can be run as the `deploy` user are prefixed with a `$` whereas commands that need to be run as `root` are prefixed with a `#`.
Instructions are based on using **Ubuntu 16.04 LTS**

## Server set up
1. Add a separate user that will be used for running the hosted applications:

    `# useradd deploy`

2. Set up `sudo`, this sets things up so the `deploy` user can run commands via `sudo` without needing to enter a password, this is required for deployments to run without user intervention:
    1. Add user to sudoers group: `# gpasswd -a deploy sudo`
    2. Allow sudo commands without entering password: `# sudo sh -c 'echo "deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/90-deploy'`
3. Add a bunch of useful packages so we can build Ruby itself along with any gems that need installing: `$ sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev python-software-properties libffi-dev nodejs`
4. Update settings in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:
    1. Disable root logins: `PermitRootLogin no`
    2. If using SSH keys, set up login via SSH keys only: `PasswordAuthentication no`


## Install Ruby

1. Set up `rbenv` and `ruby-build` for the `deploy` user:
    1. Switch to home directory: `cd`
    2. Clone the `rbenv` git repo: `$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv.git .rbenv`
    3. Add the `rbenv/bin` folder to the path: `$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile`
    4. Initialise `rbenv` when logging in: `$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile`
    5. Install the `ruby-build` plugin which can be used to build the desired version of Ruby from source: `$ git clone git://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build`
    6. Add `ruby-build/bin` to the path: `$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile`
    7. Rerun `.bash_profile` to avoid needing to log out and log back in again to pick up changes above: `$ source ~/.bash_profile`
    8. Add `rbenv-vars` plugin to allow a `.rbenv-vars` file in each application folder to be used to set environment variables for that app: `$ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-vars.git $(rbenv root)/plugins/rbenv-vars`
2. Install Ruby: `$ rbenv install -v 2.4.1`
3. Set the installed version as the default Ruby: `$ rbenv global 2.4.1`
4. Disable generation of documentation for gems (not needed in a production environment): `$ echo "gem: --no-document" > ~/.gemrc`
5. Install bundler: `$ gem install bundler`

## Install nginx
[nginx](https://nginx.org/) is used as the public facing web server:
1. Install nginx: `$ sudo apt-get install nginx `

## Install postgres
Notes are based on using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) but could use [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) instead:
1. Install postgres: `$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev`

## Application prerequisites
One-time changes that should be made to a Rails app before deploying using these notes:
1. Update the `config/puma.rb` file to include separate settings for _development_ and _production_:
 <script src="https://gist.github.com/mikej/14a2c042d9a6fe2cffbc7b5e53dc480e.js"></script>

## Application set up steps
One-time steps needed on the server to set up a new app:
1. Create a separate postgres user for the app e.g. *demoapp*
2. `$ sudo -u postgres createuser -s demoapp`
3. Set password for postgres app user:
`$ sudo -u postgres psql`
    psql (9.5.6, server 9.3.15)
    Type "help" for help.
    postgres=# \password demoapp
    Enter new password:
    Enter it again:
    postgres=# \q

4. Create a bare clone of the app repo (i.e. contains a copy of all of the git history but without a working copy): `$ git clone --bare https://github.com/mikej/demoapp.git ~/demoapp_repo`
5. Create the folder to contain the actual running copy of the app: `$ mkdir ~/demoapp`
6. Add `.rbenv-vars` file in `~/demoapp`. This file is used by the `rbenv-vars` plugin to set any necessary environment variables for the app:
    RAILS_ENV=production
    SECRET_KEY_BASE=<production secret key base>
    DATABASE_USER=demoapp_
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=<postgres password>
If your app needs to be able to send emails then this is also the place you'd add any SMTP credentials etc.
7. Copy/upload the [post-receive](https://gist.github.com/mikej/ff3e0a5648d6a6f9e2d18ff8ececcc05) hook and [update-app.sh](https://gist.github.com/mikej/d7c46f5455d294add7cf5a5d29fac392) script into the bare repo folder from step 4 (⚠️ ensure `post-receive` is readable and executable by `deploy` user)
18. Copy/upload a [systemd script for your app](https://gist.github.com/mikej/c3c29fb04ec4f9620caf328fbc1aa2f5) into `/lib/systemd/system` and symlink it into `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants`: `$ sudo ln -s /lib/systemd/system/demoapp.service /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/demoapp.service`
20. Add an [nginx config file](https://gist.github.com/mikej/b67a55b62196ff9657c7014b3edd087f) for your app in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and symlink into `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`: `$ ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/demoapp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/demoapp`
21. Start puma processes and nginx:
    `$ sudo systemctl start demoapp`
    `$ sudo systemctl restart nginx`


## Let's Encrypt
This section covers generating and installing a Let's Encrypt certificate once a basic app is up and running.
See also: [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04](view-source:http://careers.studentbeans.com/)
1. Install Let's Encrypt client: `$ sudo apt-get install letsencrypt`
2. Generate a certificate: `$ sudo letsencrypt certonly -a webroot --webroot-path=/home/mike/demoapp/public -d demoapp.josephson.org`

    `-a webroot` indicates to use webroot authentication: a file is placed in the a folder called `.well-known` under the web-root path. On running the `letsencrypt` command, a copy of this file will be requested by Let's Encrypt to verify ownership of the domain specified.
3. Generate a strong Diffie-Hellman group: `$ sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/ssl/certs/dhparam.pem 2048`
4. Create an nginx config snippet file in `/etc/nginx/snippets ` that is specific to this certificate e.g. `/etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-demoapp.josephson.org.conf`:

     <script src="https://gist.github.com/mikej/8af6b03dda4c71857221df94a682c5a4.js"></script>
5. Create a Configuration Snippet with Strong Encryption Settings. This is a file e.g. `/etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf` that can be shared across all your apps, containing a good set of SSL defaults to use for nginx. This is using the recommendations by Remy van Elst on the Cipherli.stsite. You can read more about his decisions regarding the Nginx choices [here](https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html).

    <script src="https://gist.github.com/mikej/5de57dc3edcdd1ff9ace39cc58b6cc74.js"></script>
6. Update the config file in `/etc/nginx/sites-available` to support SSL and to redirect non-https requests to the corresponding https URL e.g. using [config like this](https://gist.github.com/mikej/e8a95eac05238c6a4adb18378968321e).
7. Restart nginx: `$ sudo systemctl restart nginx`
8. Let’s Encrypt certificates are valid for 90 days, but it’s recommended that you renew the certificates every 60 days to allow a margin of error using `$ sudo letsencrypt renew`. This can be automated by setting up a daily `cron` task - if there are no certificates due for renewal at the time of running then `letsencrypt` will indicate this and exit without making any changes.
